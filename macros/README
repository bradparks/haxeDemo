This example shows the usage of macros to create types at compile time

in this sample we parse the folder logos and for each image file we create an embedded BitmapData subtype
with the @:bitmap metadata
the purpose of this sample is not so much to demonstrate the usage of @:bitmap as the possibility to
create new manipulable types at compile time through a macro

this sample is only intended for the flash platform and contains flash api calls
you will need haxe 3.0 to run this sample

run:
haxe macros.hxml
open flash/test.swf
