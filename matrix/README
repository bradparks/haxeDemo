This example demonstrates the usage of abstract types through a basic matrix use case
M44 stands for a 4 by 4 matrix of numbers, we show here how to take advantage of the
abstract type's multi cast to create the M44 type from differently formated sources
and the use of operator overloading in order to do a multiplication by a scalar using
the context-redefined * operator

you need haxe 3.0 to run this example
